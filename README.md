In this task I build classification models to predict whether the cancer type is Malignant or Benign.
Also fine-tune the hyperparameters & compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms.

Support Vector Machine model was trained and I got accuracy 0.96


## Decision Tree Classifier

Decision Tree Classification model was trained and I got accuracy 0.92

## Conclusion

In this task, I predicted the cancer type is Malignant or Benign.
